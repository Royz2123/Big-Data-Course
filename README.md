# Big-Data-Course
A collection of homework assignments from the Big Data course from Haifa University

## Overview
The following projects are python implementations of Big Data techniques using Data Coresets. The main idea is taking a huge amount of data, and compressing it into a smaller (core) set that represents it and has properties with regards to the original data.


## Examples
Here are a few examples of the many things we implemented in this course


### Epsilon sample
Here's an example you can find in HW2, that finds an e-sample of a set. The idea is taking a group of d dimensional points and breaking them down into (1/epsilon)^d representatives. This is used many times by more complex algorithms. Below is an example for d = 2:
